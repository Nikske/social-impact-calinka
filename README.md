[The template I used](https://html5up.net/twenty)

Using a template was more time consuming then I thought, especially when I wanted to customise little things and had to dig through several thousands lines of code that I didn't write to find that one particular one. I think I prefer doing things myself but that's probably going to change, I assume.
